      <h3>The future of workplace design; an example of LinkedIn hybrid office</h3>  
        <p>by <a href="contact-al.html">A. Lungu</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; 18/05/2023 <br />Architectural Designer Freelancer <br /><br /><a href="images/linkedin01.png"><img src="images/linkedin01.png" style="width:350px;height:250px" alt="3D house design"></a></p>  
      <p><!--<button class="button button2"><a href="verify-btn.html" target="_blank" class="lead">unverified</a></button>--> Project by <a href="https://www.nbbj.com/" target="_blank">NBBJ</a> Architecture & Design firm,  US <br /><br />
The future of workplace design is evolving, and one of the emerging trends is the hybrid office model, which combines remote work with in-person collaboration. LinkedIn is one company that has adopted this model, and its approach to workplace design provides insight into the future of the hybrid office.</p>
<div  class="btn-mat" onclick="elem6Function()">...continue reading</div>
<div id="element6" style="display: none;">
<p>With more than 70 different types of sitting, LinkedIn's hybrid office is designed to support a range of work styles and needs.  The entry to the building presents a more social arrangement with a cafe just right at the reception,  while as you go further into the building it becomes more focused. The design incorporates flexible workstations, co-working spaces, meeting rooms with conference rooms looking like living rooms, and communal areas, as well as technology that supports remote collaboration.</p>
<a href="images/linkedin03.png"><img src="images/linkedin03.png" width="350" height="250"  alt="linkedin office"> </a>
<a href="images/linkedin04.png"><img src="images/linkedin04.png" width="350" height="250"  alt="linkedin office"> </a>
<p>In order to improve employee well been, LinkedIn has included social spaces in its workplace design. These social spaces include amenities such as a cafe, fitness center, and a game room that encourages employees to take breaks and socialize. In addition, it incorporates features such as natural light, greenery, and ergonomic furniture supporting different types of work for a given time period.</p>
<a href="images/linkedin02.png"><img src="images/linkedin02.png" width="350" height="250" alt="linkedin office"> </a>
<p>Overall, LinkedIn's hybrid office demonstrates that workplace design is evolving to support the needs and preferences of employees in a rapidly changing work environment. The future of workplace design is likely to include more flexible and adaptable spaces, technology that supports remote collaboration, and a focus on employee well-being.</p>
